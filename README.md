# HIND_PLOTTING_PROTECTION_PLUGIN_PYTHON




The objective of this project HIND PLOTTING PROTECTION PLUGIN is to develop a 
website which has capability to restrict and block the transaction performing by attacker 
from genuine user’s credit card details. The system here is developed for the transactions 
higher than the customer’s current transaction limit.  We tried to detect fraudulent 
transaction before transaction succeeds. During registration we take required information 
which is efficient to detect fraudulent user activity. An FDS runs at a credit card issuing
bank. Each incoming transaction is submitted to the FDS for verification. FDS receives 
the card details and transaction value to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not. 
The types of goods that are bought in that transaction are not known to the FDS. Bank 
declines the transaction if FDS confirms the transaction to be fraud.
The frontend of this project Django framework, python 3.8 , CSS, java script 
and the backend is MySQL server 5.6 which makes it easy for creating and generating
code.
